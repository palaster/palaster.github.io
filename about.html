                    Hello. My name is Pat Laster (aka Palaster). Born and raised in Louisiana, I took to computers early in my life.
                    My first programming experience (self-taught) was developing mods for Minecraft (in Java) in early high school.
                    I started learning in an official capacity when I took Computer Science I, Computer Science II, and Webdesign in high school.
                    After I graduated high school, I started the Computer Science Bachelor's program at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
                    I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2020. <br />
                    My hobbies include reading (my genre of choice is fantasy), gaming, and repairing retro consoles. My personal goals are to write a novel and complete and release a video game.
